## üì± Viewing on Mobile Devices

### Option 1: Expo Go App (Recommended for Development)

#### For iOS:
1. **Install Expo Go** from the App Store
2. **Start the development server** with `npm run dev`
3. **Scan the QR code** displayed in the terminal or browser using:
   - iPhone Camera app (iOS 11+)

2. **Start the development server** with `npm run dev`
3. **Scan the QR code** using Expo Go app's scanner
4. **Open in Expo Go** when prompted

### Option 2: Development Build (For Production-like Testing)

For features that require native code or to test the app in a production-like environment:

#### Prerequisites:
- Expo CLI: `npm install -g @expo/cli`
- EAS CLI: `npm install -g eas-cli`

#### Create Development Build:

1. **Configure EAS Build**
   ```bash
   eas build:configure
   ```

2. **Build for iOS**
   ```bash
   eas build --platform ios --profile development
   ```

3. **Build for Android**
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile development
   ```

4. **Install on Device**
   - **iOS**: Install via TestFlight or direct installation
   - **Android**: Download and install the APK file

### Option 3: Local Simulators

#### iOS Simulator (macOS only):
1. **Install Xcode** from the Mac App Store
2. **Start development server** with `npm run dev`
3. **Press 'i'** in the terminal to open iOS simulator
4. **Select device** from the simulator menu

#### Android Emulator:
1. **Install Android Studio**
2. **Set up Android Virtual Device (AVD)**
3. **Start development server** with `npm run dev`
4. **Press 'a'** in the terminal to open Android emulator

### Option 4: Physical Device via USB (Advanced)

#### For iOS:
1. **Enable Developer Mode** on your iPhone
2. **Connect via USB** and trust the computer
3. **Use Xcode** to install the development build

#### For Android:
1. **Enable Developer Options** in Settings
2. **Enable USB Debugging**
3. **Connect via USB** and allow debugging
4. **Install APK** using `adb install app.apk`

### Troubleshooting Mobile Viewing

#### Common Issues:
- **QR Code not scanning**: Ensure both devices are on the same network
- **App not loading**: Check firewall settings and network connectivity
- **Performance issues**: Use development build for better performance
- **Features not working**: Some features require native code (use development build)

#### Network Requirements:
- Both computer and mobile device must be on the same WiFi network
- Corporate networks may block the connection
- Use mobile hotspot if network issues persist

### Build for Production

```bash
# Build for web deployment
npm run build:web

# Build for app stores
eas build --platform all --profile production
```

## üí≥ Payments Integration

### RevenueCat for Mobile Subscriptions

When adding subscriptions or in-app purchases to the app, use **RevenueCat** - the best solution for mobile subscriptions and in-app purchases.

#### Why RevenueCat?
- Handles billing, entitlements, analytics, and receipt validation out of the box
- Supports both Apple App Store and Google Play Store billing
- Makes it easier for developers to monetize their apps without building complex infrastructure

#### Important Notes:
- **Native Code Required**: RevenueCat requires native code and will not function in Bolt's in-browser preview
- **Export Required**: Since Bolt projects are built on Expo, you'll need to export your project and open it locally (e.g., in Cursor or VS Code) to install the RevenueCat SDK
- **Development Build**: To test purchases, create a development build using the Expo Dev Client

#### Getting Started:
1. **Export your project** from Bolt to your local development environment
2. **Follow the official guide**: https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started/installation/expo
3. **Create development build** for testing purchases on real devices

#### Important:
**DO NOT use Stripe** for mobile platform subscriptions as it does not support Apple or Google billing. RevenueCat is the preferred tool for mobile subscription use cases.

## üìä State Management

### Redux Store Structure
```typescript
{
  appointments: {
    appointments: Appointment[],
    loading: boolean,
    error: string | null,
    filter: 'all' | 'scheduled' | 'completed' | 'cancelled'
  },

    loading: boolean,
    error: string | null
  }
}
```

### Data Models
```typescript
interface Appointment {
  id: string;
  patientName: string;
  age: number;
  symptoms: string;
  time: string;
  date: string;
  phone: string;
  email: string;
  status: 'scheduled' | 'completed' | 'cancelled';
  notes?: string;
}

interface Prescription {
  id: string;
  appointmentId: string;
  medicineName: string;
  dosage: string;
  instructions: string;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

## üîß Key Decisions & Assumptions

### Architecture Decisions

1. **File-based Routing**: Used Expo Router for intuitive navigation structure
2. **Tab Navigation**: Primary navigation pattern for easy access to main features
3. **Redux Toolkit**: Chosen for predictable state management and excellent DevTools
4. **Mock Backend**: Implemented realistic API simulation for demonstration purposes
5. **Component Modularity**: Each component focuses on a single responsibility
6. **Web-First Platform**: Default platform is Web with mobile compatibility
7. **Expo Managed Workflow**: Uses Expo managed workflow exclusively (no native code directories)

### Design Decisions

1. **Theme System**: Implemented comprehensive dark/light theme with automatic detection
2. **Typography**: Used Inter font family for modern, readable interface
3. **Color System**: Created semantic color tokens for consistent theming
4. **Spacing**: 8px base unit system for consistent layouts
5. **Animations**: Subtle micro-interactions to enhance user experience
6. **Styling**: Uses `StyleSheet.create` exclusively (no NativeWind or alternative styling libraries)

### Technical Assumptions

1. **Platform Target**: Primarily web-focused with mobile compatibility
2. **Data Persistence**: Mock data resets on app restart (no backend integration)
3. **Authentication**: Assumed single doctor user (no login system)
4. **Offline Support**: Not implemented (requires backend integration)
5. **Real-time Updates**: Not implemented (would require WebSocket/Server-Sent Events)
6. **Native APIs**: Limited to web-compatible APIs (no Haptics, Local Authentication, etc.)
7. **Error Handling**: Prefers showing errors directly in UI instead of Alert API

### Business Logic Assumptions

1. **Appointment Scheduling**: Assumed appointments are pre-scheduled by external system
2. **Patient Data**: Mock data represents realistic medical scenarios
3. **Prescription Workflow**: Simplified prescription creation without drug interaction checks
4. **Status Management**: Doctors can update appointment status manually
5. **Data Validation**: Basic client-side validation for prescription forms

### Framework Constraints

1. **Required Hook**: The `useFrameworkReady` hook in `app/_layout.tsx` is REQUIRED and must NEVER be removed or modified
2. **Navigation Structure**: All routes must be placed in the `/app` directory
3. **Component Organization**: Reusable components must be placed in the `/components` directory
4. **Environment Variables**: Uses Expo's environment variable system (not Vite)
5. **Font Management**: Uses `@expo-google-fonts` packages exclusively
